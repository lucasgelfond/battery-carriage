I was recently building a quadcopter, the Hoverthings Flip Sport and I came across a problem - I couldn't fit the battery on top (my flight controller was there), in the middle (very small space, plus my power distribution board was there), or on the bottom (camera/camera mount on the bottom). So after ruling out the bottom as I already have a camera there and ruling out the middle because of its small space, I decided to mount to the top. As far as I can tell, this model is FULLY PARAMETRIC and you could potentially adapt it to any battery, any mounting hole pattern, and really anything. I've commented the descriptions of all of the variables for easy access.

Enjoy yourself.
